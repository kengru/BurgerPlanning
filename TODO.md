## Things to do.

1. Make the error message for authorization better.
2. Document codes and functions.
3. Convert normal strings to string literals, the ones who need it.
4. Use the update object where it's needed.
5. Test everything testable.
6. Save the user's direction and have a check to possibly make it default.
